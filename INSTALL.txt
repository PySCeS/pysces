PySCeS (http://pysces.sourceforge.net) installation
===================================================

Please see README.txt and LICENCE.txt for licence/distribution information.

PySCeS is developed primarily in Python and has been designed to
operate on both the Linux and Microsoft Windows operating systems.

PySCeS makes use of SciPy with NumPy for a number of functions
and needs a working NumPy/SciPy installation to install and run.

Additional PySCeS modules
-------------------------

PySCeS functionality has been modularised it is highly recommended that
the following packages/modules are also installed.

- *PySundials* Windows users should install the pysces_pysundials (win32 only) package to enable CVODE support. 

Linux users should install the Sundials libraries and the PySundials package
(pysundials.sourceforge.net)

- *pysces_metatool* this adds elementary mode support to PySCeS

General requirements
--------------------

- Python 2.5+
- Numpy 1.2.1+
- SciPy 0.7.0+
- Matplotlib (with TKagg backend,)
- GnuPlot (optional)
- IPython (optional)
- libSBML (optional)

Win32 build
-----------

Most requirements for building are incuded in the Enthought Python Distribution

MinGW (http://www.mingw.org) with, minimun GCC 3.4.5 is recommended with mingw\bin in path

Once MinGW is set up, change to the PySCeS install directory and do a:

- `python setup.py config --compiler=mingw32 build --compiler=mingw32 install`

This should install PySCeS into the site-packages directory.

Linux build
-----------

gcc 3.4.x (with g77 and g++) or
gcc 4.1+ (with gfortran and g++)

cd to the PySCeS source and run:

- `python setup.py install`

Apple Macbuild
--------------

- install the Enthought Python Distribution (EPD 6)
- install XCode 3.2.2+ (with GCC 4.2.1+)
- `python setup.py install`

Make sure the `python` command you call to build is the EPD one and not some
system Python.

# PySCeS changes (per GitHub release)

## PySCeS release 0.9.8 (May 2020)

We are pleased to announce the release of the Python Simulator for Cellular Systems:
PySCeS (http://pysces.sourceforge.net) version 0.9.8

**What's new in this release:**

* The main change from a user perspective is that the default model directory and output
  directory on Windows have moved to `%USERPROFILE%\Pysces` and subfolders 
  (e.g. `C:\Users\<username>\Pysces`). These folders are created by default on a fresh
  install. The previous default location was `C:\Pysces`. This change brings the Windows
  version in line with the Linux and macOS versions, and moreover allows multiple users
  to maintain their individual PySCeS configurations and model files on the same Windows
  machine.

* If you are **upgrading** from a previous version: For backward compatibility, the
  original location is searched first, and used if found upon startup, so that existing
  installations should continue to function as previously.

* Users wishing to **migrate** the PySCeS directory to the new location without losing
  any work should move the folder `C:\Pysces` to `C:\Users\<username>\Pysces`, and then
  edit the `model_dir` and `output_dir` keys in the configuration
  file `C:\Users\<username>\Pysces\.pys_usercfg.ini` to reflect the new paths.

* Numerous bug fixes relating to Python 3 compatibility.

* Other bug fixes.

PySCeS has its own project on the Anaconda cloud: https://anaconda.org/pysces

Install the latest version from the new site (Python 3.6 - 3.8) using:

```bash    
conda install -c sbmlteam -c pysces pysces
```

If you are not using Anaconda, binary wheels are provided on PyPI for Windows, Linux and
macOS (Python 3.6 - 3.8), which can be installed using:

```bash
pip install pysces
```

With Python 2 having reached its end of life, binaries for Python 2.7 are no longer
provided. However, the PySCeS codebase continues to run under Python 2.7 and can be
compiled from source if needed.

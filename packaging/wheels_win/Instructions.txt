**Building PySCeS Windows binaries for distribution**

This requires a Python 2.7 environment with the following 
packages installed:
	certifi 
	icc_rt 
	intel-openmp 
	libpython 
	mkl 
	numpy=1.11.3 
	pip 
	setuptools 
	vc 
	vs2008_runtime 
	wheel 
	wincertstore

A batch file that does this automatically for the Anaconda 
Python distribution is included (create_environment.bat).

For Anaconda specifically, the environment has to be fixed 
by copying two library files. Activate the newly created
environment, and then execute the batch file
fix_environment.bat.

Then cd to the root folder of the PySCeS source repository
and execute winbuild_mingw.bat

This will build a source tarball, a Windows binary executable
installer, as well as a Python Wheel in the "dist" folder.

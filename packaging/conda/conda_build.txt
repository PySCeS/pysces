Open an anaconda prompt

cd to conda build files

Optional: update build version and SVN information in meta.yaml
 conda update conda
 conda update conda-build

Run to build (note the upload command path e.g. anaconda upload C:\Anaconda\conda-bld\win-64\pysces-0.9.5-py27hd5793fb_1.tar.bz2): 
 conda build -c sbmlteam .
 
Run to install locally:
 conda install --use-local pysces

NOTES: 
* To get this to compile under windows requires one to copy python27.dll into the lib directory while the environment is being created. 
otherwise the build fails.
* Under linux/mac remove the libpython build dependency (it does not exist)
